We created `gchromVAR` is an `R` package for performing enrichment analyses of genome-wide chromatin accessibility data with summary statistics (posterior-probability values) from common-variant associaitons. 

This vignette covers basic usage of `chromVAR` with standard inputs. For more detailed documentation covering different options for various inputs and additional applications, view the additional vignettes on the [documentation website](https://greenleaflab.github.io/chromVAR/). For more description of the method and applications, please see the [publication](https://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nmeth.4401.html)
